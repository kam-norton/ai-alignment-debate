This heuristic is practical, but it assumes the operator can reliably detect which side track appeared to have fewer people at the moment of observation, which may not always be clear.\n\nTo address this, I propose slightly expanding the operator’s preparation: before the trolley arrives, the operator should quickly scan both side tracks to note any visible differences in the number of people, if possible, within a few seconds. This prep step can be integrated into the 3-second window or immediately before it begins.
